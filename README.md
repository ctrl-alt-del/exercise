## Setup
### Android SDK
First of all, we need to setup Android SDK on you machine.  we follow my instruction [here](https://github.com/ctrl-alt-del/devenv#android-sdk) to setup the Android SDK on Mac.

Once Android SDK is setup, make sure your packages are up to date.

In order to use some of the libraries that are introduced in this exercise, you may also need to install the following packages through the SDK Manager.
```sh
/Extra/Goolge Support Library
/Extra/Goolge Support Repository
/Extra/Goolge Play service
/Extra/Goolge Repository
```

### Android Developer Tool (ADT) Plugin
Make sure the ADT Plugin for Eclipse is up to date.  This is very important, otherwise, the IDE may not load the project properly.
